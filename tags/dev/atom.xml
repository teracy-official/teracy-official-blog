    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Docker is great to work with, it solves a lot of problems on development, distribution, and production
deployment.</p>

<p>Why Docker?  You can find the answer here:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://thenewstack.io/why-did-docker-catch-on-quickly-and-why-is-it-so-interesting/">http://thenewstack.io/why-did-docker-catch-on-quickly-and-why-is-it-so-interesting/</a></li>

<li><a href="https://blog.codeship.com/why-docker/">https://blog.codeship.com/why-docker/</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Docker works great on Linux, however, it&rsquo;s very challenging to make it work universal and consistent on
Mac and Windows. There are lots of efforts to solve this problem, from Docker themselves and from
Docker community, too. However, we haven&rsquo;t achieved that stage yet (until <code>teracy-dev</code>).</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>These are some of the problems that Docker community has to deal with on Mac and Windows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>No consistent universal development environment and workflow on Linux, Windows, Mac. This is a very
important factor for team collaboration so that anyone from any OS platforms could collaborate and help
each other with no differences in the development environment.</p></li>
<li><p>Mounted volumes on VirtualBox use vboxsf, which is extremely slow. This is true for Boot2Docker and
Vagrant default file sync mechanism on Virtualbox.</p></li>
<li><p>Native Docker applications offered by Docker:</p>

<ul>
<li>Slow on Mac: <a href="https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/77">https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/77</a></li>
<li>Only recent latest versions of Window 10 (&ldquo;Build 10586 or later&rdquo;) are supported</li>
<li>Slow on Windows: <a href="https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/188">https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/188</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>File watching is broken on VirtualBox since vboxsf does not trigger the inotify file watching
mechanism. <code>nodemon</code>, hello?</p></li>
</ul>


<p>There are a lot of Docker community projects trying to solve those problems:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/brikis98/docker-osx-dev">https://github.com/brikis98/docker-osx-dev</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/blinkreaction/boot2docker-vagrant">https://github.com/blinkreaction/boot2docker-vagrant</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/codekitchen/dinghy">https://github.com/codekitchen/dinghy</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/leighmcculloch/docker-unison">https://github.com/leighmcculloch/docker-unison</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/gansbrest/hodor">https://github.com/gansbrest/hodor</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/adlogix/docker-machine-nfs">https://github.com/adlogix/docker-machine-nfs</a></li>
<li>others&hellip;</li>
</ul>


<p>However, those existing projects do not really resolve all the problems or do not reflect
our vision for a productive development platform.</p>

<p>You can check out our <a href="/2016/08/19/teracy-dev-vision/">vision for teracy-dev</a> for such the
productive development platform.</p>

<p>That is the reason why we created <code>teracy-dev</code>. We&rsquo;ve been using and loving it for more than 3 years
and counting.</p>

<p><code>teracy-dev</code> reflects our vision for a truly universal productive development platform that anyone can
use to develop software easily. It&rsquo;s very easy to customize any OS that you can use
for your VM. It brings development and production environment closer and closer.</p>

<p>It is very important for a distributed team like us to work with everyone from different teams all
over the world on different projects with different stacks and <code>teracy-dev</code> helps us a lot.</p>

<p>Moreover, <code>teracy-dev</code> is not tightly coupled with anything, you&rsquo;re free to choose anything to build
up your development VM machine. You can choose different OS platforms, choose different software packages to
be automatically installed with the help of different configuration management tools. It&rsquo;s up
to you to choose anything other than default settings.</p>

<p>With default settings, <code>teracy-dev</code> chooses Ubuntu as the base OS with <code>docker</code> and <code>docker-compose</code>
installed to start developing software with Docker right away after <code>$ vagrant up</code>.</p>

<p>teracy-dev v0.5.0 is leveraging Docker for development as we believe in the future of containers
and Docker.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s have some comparisons between <code>teracy-dev</code> and other solutions:</p>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>‚úÖ: fully support</p>

<p>‚ùå: no or partial support</p>

<p>üö´: can be achieved but not encouraged</p>

<p>Let me explain the criteria:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>&ldquo;same workflow on Linux, Mac, Windows&rdquo;: the usage should be the same on Mac, Linux, Windows.
Docker native app only supports >= Windows 10, that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s marked as ‚ùå.</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;native speed on mounted volumes&rdquo;: the speed should be as fast and native as on Linux</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;2-way file sync&rdquo;: for syncing back and forth on mounted volumes, this is mandatory for development</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;file watching (inotify)&rdquo;: for auto reload when files change</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;customization&rdquo;: you have full control and are encouraged to change anything that you want to
suit your need, no hidden stuff, no lock-in and can still upgrade seamlessly.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Let&rsquo;s see what the same workflow means when developing a simple hello world <code>nodejs</code> application
from scratch with teracy-dev by watching the following videos:</p>

<p>On Linux (Ubuntu):</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ze8p9imprgk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>On Windows:</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2200zvxIdAs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>On macOS:</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XF-FQQKG8PA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>They all contain the same steps, that&rsquo;s the meaning of the &ldquo;same workflow&rdquo;.</p>

<p><code>teracy-dev</code> is not perfect, though. There are some improvements that we&rsquo;d like to address.</p>

<p>The first thing we&rsquo;d like to improve is to reduce the setup time. It takes time (around 20-30 mins)
to download the vagrant box (Ubuntu 16.04) for the first time. This is for the first time only, however.
After the first time, you can destroy and provision the same VM within some minutes. We could use
some other smaller boxes (for example, boot2docker base box) but we&rsquo;d like to stick to the most popular
Linux OS that is widely used in production. We try to make development and production environment as
close as possible. This is by default, you can choose different base boxes as you wish.</p>

<p><code>teracy-dev</code> v0.5.0 is under preview stage, we need to add more documentation and get more community
feedback.</p>

<p><code>teracy-dev</code> is created to give back to open source community as we learn and get a lot from our amazing
open source community.</p>

<p>And we need you, please try and let us know your feedback and we&rsquo;ll together fix any problems.</p>

<p>You should get started with <code>teracy-dev</code> here: <a href="http://dev.teracy.org/docs/develop/getting_started.html">http://dev.teracy.org/docs/develop/getting_started.html</a></p>

<p>In summary, <code>teracy-dev</code> brings <code>Docker</code> closer to <code>Vagrant</code> = love.</p>

<p>Thank you and happy hacking with <a href="https://github.com/teracyhq/dev">teracy-dev</a>!</p>

    <id>http://blog.teracy.com/2016/08/19/teracy-dev-vision</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>teracy-dev has been being developed and in use from the first days of Teracy, it&rsquo;s been
about 3 years<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> now. We&rsquo;re in a hurry for a really big, exciting release for the next version of
teracy-dev. I&rsquo;d like to take this chance to share with you about teracy-dev vision first and many
other new features and improvements for the next long awaiting teracy-dev release.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Let&rsquo;s get started with a story about my first working days as a developer when joining my first
company 8 years ago. As developers, it&rsquo;s expected that we should have our development environment
ready before starting coding. At that time, my company used Maven to build Java projects and I was
required to install it. However, as a junior, I had difficulties to install it on the Ubuntu
computer provided to me. I struggled with it for nearly a day and eventually I had to ask for
help to install it successfully. This is a true story. Now I can even install it in just some
minutes with a few lines of commands because I have more experience.</p>

<p>Now just imagine what if juniors don&rsquo;t have to set up these boring tools each by each but just enjoy
coding, that&rsquo;s the more fun part. What if all developers should have the same development environment
even they use different kinds of operating systems so that we don&rsquo;t have to deal with the very common
problem: &ldquo;But it works on my machine&rdquo;. What if the production environment is easily set up exactly
the same on a developer machine to debug and fix things and vice versa?</p>

<p>These what ifs lead us to use <code>vagrant</code> as the base to complete these things as the first days of
Teracy journey. We&rsquo;d like to upgrade the vagrant dev environment easily, for example, <code>$ git pull</code>
then <code>$ vagrant reload --provision</code> and you&rsquo;re done. We have default configuration and we could
override it easily. We&rsquo;d like to use this development environment for all our projects: from our
internal projects to our clients' projects.</p>

<p>We created teracy-dev to solve the mentioned problems above, help boost our productivity and it could
even help us more than that. Everyone just enjoys it, we don&rsquo;t have to deal with installing things
manually, it&rsquo;s auto provided with just one command (<code>$ vagrant up</code>) thanks to the provision software.
We&rsquo;re using Chef to provision but we can use others to provision, too, for example Ansible, Puppet, etc.</p>

<p>We see that teracy-dev is so useful for developers, so we&rsquo;d like to share it, shape its future
together with anyone who wants to work with software. And we envision teracy-dev with the following
statement:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>teracy-dev is the best universal development tool for everyone.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s our vision for teracy-dev as the base development platform and we&rsquo;re going to make it true.
Note that it should be used for everyone, even with our QA engineers, with our manual testers, with
our employees, with our users as long as they follow exactly a little setup instruction guide.</p>

<p>I believe that everyone should use it as much as we enjoy using and developing it. It&rsquo;s been saving
us and our clients a lot of money as we don&rsquo;t have to spend the time to set up development environment
for each and every project manually.</p>

<p>We improve it day by day though our projects, we listen to our developers, our clients for feedback
on usage and development. However, we still have some problems with it. For example, on Windows, the
file sharing system is really slow. It&rsquo;s not really lightweight and modular enough to serve every
project&rsquo;s needs.</p>

<p>We know all these problems and we&rsquo;re going to fix these all with the next version by leveraging
Docker and Rsync. We intended to use Docker for long, we expected it should be in use since
teracy-dev v0.4.0 but we failed to make it. Now we promise you that teracy-dev v0.5.0 will leverage
Docker as the core workflow and it will rule the world of developers.</p>

<p>We will add more documentation for usage, accelerate the development pace so that you should benefit
from it as we do. Let&rsquo;s try using it once with
<a href="http://dev.teracy.org/docs/0.4.2/getting_started.html">teracy-dev v0.4.2</a>, it&rsquo;s open source and
totally free. You will love it as we do now for 3 years and counting. Let&rsquo;s together make it better
and better and better.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.teracy.com/2014/07/17/teracy-dev-v0-3-0-release/"/>
    <updated>2014-07-17T03:39:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.teracy.com/2014/07/17/teracy-dev-v0-3-0-release</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="/images/2014/07/binary_code.jpg"></p>

<p>Creating an isolated consistent development with a predefined consistent workflow is always our
goal of development, that is the reason why we create <a href="https://github.com/teracyhq/dev">teracy-dev</a>. It is a virtualbox virtual
machine (VM) that is provisioned by <code>Chef</code><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and managed by <code>vagrant</code><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. Today, we are very happy
to announce <a href="https://github.com/teracyhq/dev">teracy-dev</a> v0.3.0 released  after more than a year of development and usage.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>We have used <code>vagrant</code> and <code>Chef</code> to provision a common VM for all our developers.
It saves a lot of time and is a very cheap operation to destroy and provision a new VM again in minutes
with the exactly defined provisioned software packages.</p>

<p>We are now using <code>Chef</code> to provision a VM with <code>nodejs</code>, <code>mysql</code>, <code>php</code>, <code>coldfusion</code> for a client to
develop a wordpress, a coldfusion and a MVC client (using backone.js with Grunt build), and it works
great.</p>

<p>Normally, it takes several days for new developers to install every packages on
their machines and they must follow instruction guide, but not anymore with <a href="https://github.com/teracyhq/dev">teracy-dev</a>.
Every new developer just needs 2-3 hours to get the dev VM provisoned for the first time (to
download the basebox thanks to <code>vagrant cloud</code>) and it just takes less than 1 minute to
<code>$ vagrant destroy</code> and <code>$ vagrant up</code> later again &ndash; this is a very cheap operation.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/teracyhq/dev">teracy-dev</a> is really a general-purpose development environment for all developers for all platforms
(<code>nodejs</code>, <code>python</code>, <code>java</code>, <code>php</code>, <code>mysql</code>, <code>posgreSQL</code>, <code>mongodb</code>) built-in and you could extend
more by using <code>Chef</code> to create more cookbooks or recipes for it.</p>

<p>However, we still have performance problem with shared folders. It is still quite slow and
painful on Windows host machine. We are going to fix this problem on the next version (v0.4.0).</p>

<p><code>docker</code><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> is very promising and we&rsquo;d like to use it for our workflow at v0.4.0, too.</p>

<p>Please stay tuned for our upcoming exciting release version.</p>

<p>Have a nice day and happy coding!</p>
