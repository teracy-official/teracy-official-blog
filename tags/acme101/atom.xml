<p>About six months ago we published
<a href="/2016/09/22/how-to-develop-angular-2-applications-easily-with-docker-and-angular-cli/">How to Develop Angular 2 Applications Easily With Docker and Angular-cli</a> which received a lot of
Angular community feedbacks and questions.</p>

<p>Six months has passed and we&rsquo;d like to share more best practices to develop Angular applications with
Docker after working on it for a while.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Received Feedbacks</h2>

<p>We received some outstanding feedbacks and questions about:</p>

<ul>
<li>Problems when running Docker images after pulling the built Docker images.</li>
<li>How to build prod Docker image and run it.</li>
<li>How to get <code>npm</code> packages into the <code>node_modules</code> to work within your IDE, editor.</li>
</ul>


<p>And in this blog post, we&rsquo;re going to solve all of them and even with more best practices.</p>

<h2>angular-boilerplate</h2>

<p>Setting up Angular projects with Docker to get it work properly is not easy. Luckily, we&rsquo;ve done
all the heavy lifting for you with the <code>angular-boilerplate</code> project.</p>

<p><code>angular-boilerplate</code> was created as a seed project that can be used to generate any new Angular
projects having Docker and CI/CD system support.</p>

<p>To generate a new Angular project, you can check out the
<a href="https://github.com/teracyhq/angular-boilerplate/blob/master/README.md">README.md</a> file to follow.</p>

<h2>angular-hello-world</h2>

<p>In this section, I&rsquo;ll introduce you the best way to set up a development environment and you can apply
it for all your projects, not just Angular projects. After some first required steps to set up
<code>acme-dev</code>, after <code>$ vagrant up</code>, you can start coding immediately, you don&rsquo;t have to learn the set
up steps at first, but defer it later.</p>

<p>Suppose that we&rsquo;re in Acme organization and we need to work on the <code>angular-hello-world</code> project.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s follow the README file here: <a href="https://github.com/acme101/angular-hello-world">https://github.com/acme101/angular-hello-world</a></p>

<p>It tells us to follow <a href="https://github.com/acme101/dev-setup/blob/master/README.md">https://github.com/acme101/dev-setup/blob/master/README.md</a></p>

<p>By setting up <code>acme-dev</code>, we can use it for all types of projects with different stacks with the same
set up workflow, it means that we can save a lot of time and effort to add more and more projects.</p>

<p>Re-using and scaling boots productivity and cost savings.</p>

<h2>Best practices</h2>

<p>By looking into the <code>angular-boilerplate</code> or <code>angular-hello-world</code>, you can see the following best
practices:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We should build the production Docker image for production deployment.</p></li>
<li><p>We should work on dev mode on local dev.</p></li>
<li><p>We should work on prod mode on local dev.</p></li>
<li><p>We should review others' work on local dev.</p></li>
<li><p>We should use alias domains instead of fixed ports to avoid conflicts.</p></li>
<li><p>We should generate <code>node_modules</code> to work on the npm packages safely within your IDE.</p></li>
<li><p>We should use <code>yarn</code> instead <code>npm</code> as the node package manager.</p></li>
<li><p>We should test both dev and prod modes on local dev.</p></li>
<li><p>We should test both http and https modes on local dev.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>All the instruction should be updated in the README file, please follow there to apply for your
project: <a href="https://github.com/acme101/angular-hello-world/blob/develop/README.md">https://github.com/acme101/angular-hello-world/blob/develop/README.md</a></p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>All the heavy lifting and best practices are documented into the corresponding projects, that&rsquo;s how
we should do so that everyone can follow easily and we can support each other with ease, too.</p>

<p>Hopefully, this will help you a lot with your Angular projects and any other projects that you can
apply similarly.</p>

<p>Happy hacking and don&rsquo;t forget to let us know your feedbacks and questions by leaving your comments!</p>
