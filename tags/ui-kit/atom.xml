<p>Itâ€™s always a good idea to begin with a wireframe when beginning a new web design or mobile app project.
Wireframes can be a big time saver as they help both designers and developers come to an agreement on placement
of major UI elements. The key is to get the layout nailed down so you don&rsquo;t have to change major layout when
 detailed design elements are in place.</p>

<p>In our design process at Teracy, wireframing and mockups takes an important position. We have developed
a wireframe kit to speedup the design process and use it in our daily design workflow. Today, we are excited
 to share the version of our wireframe kit that we are using, which includes the most common UI elements
in web projects. This is the second UI kit we share to <a href="http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/">Sketch</a> community, you can also check out our first freebie <a href="https://github.com/teracy-official/bootflat-ui-kit.sketch">Bootflat UI kit for Sketch</a> shared not a long time ago.</p>

<p><strong><em>Why Sketch?</em></strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/">Sketch</a> is a powerful tool designed entirely to do UI. It&rsquo;s a young graphic program when compared
to Photoshop but we see its user base&rsquo;s growing strong. Centered around vector design, Sketch is
getting plenty of buzz among UI designers as an alternative to Adobe&rsquo;s Creative Suite. With Sketch,
designs come out pixel perfect and in vector format, a requirement for multiple screen sizes.</p>

<p>You may not believe how much time this application have saved us when designing UI. It&rsquo;s simple,
fast and so connected to the way designers work. You definitely should give Sketch a try in your
next project. There are already a lot of articles about how Sketch excels in designing UI. Here to
name a few:</p>

<p><strong><em>Bootflat UI Kit</em></strong></p>

<p>At the beginning, Teracy planned to develop its own UI kit and framework based on bootstrap. It&rsquo;s a
great experience but developing and maintaining the UI kit will take time. Clock&rsquo;s still ticking.
We have to release one of our ambitious products by the end of this year.
So, we&rsquo;ve come to decide on finding an open source framework that matches our flat designs.</p>

<p>And we found <a href="http://bootflat.github.io/">Bootflat</a> &ndash; an open source Flat UI kit based on Twitter Bootstrap 3 framework. For
designers, they offer a free PSD, including a set of beautiful and pure elements, which you can
use to create startup projects, websites or iOS/Android Apps. This will save a lot of developing
time.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s still one thing that&rsquo;s bugging us though. As our company starts switching to Sketch for UI
design, this beautiful framework doesn&rsquo;t provide the .sketch file of elements, only .psd. So we
think &ldquo;OK, why not create one? Sketch community might find it helpful and it&rsquo;s also good for
creators of Bootflat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So here it is, hope it&rsquo;s useful for Sketch lovers!</p>
