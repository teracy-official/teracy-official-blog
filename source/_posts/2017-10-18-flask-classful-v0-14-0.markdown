`Flask-Classful` v0.14.0 is the most significant release version since we decided to fork `Flask-Classy`
in August 2015 to continue the project development. To be honest, this release also has the most
community contribution yet. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank everyone involved, without
your support and contribution, releasing this version is impossible.

What's new?
-----------

So what's new with this release?

We have released `Flask-Classful` v0.6.11, v0.7.0, v0.7.1, v0.8.0, v0.9.0, v0.10.0, v0.11.0, v0.12.0,
v0.13.0, v0.13.1 since the fork, but mostly for bug fixes and small improvements.

v0.14.0 introduces a lot of exciting changes that you'd love to use it right away. These are some of
the most exciting changes:

- Type hints support for py3
- `base_class` introduced
- Add options passing to `werkzeug.Routing.Rule` from register function
- Enable using custom decorators in FlaskView
- Should allow specifying excluded methods from becoming routes
- Better representations
- Docker workflow along with teracy-dev for better dev setup

You should check out the changelog and the docs for more detailed information:

- Changelog: https://github.com/teracyhq/flask-classful/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md#2017-10-05-hoat-le-hoatleteracycom

- Docs: http://flask-classful.teracy.org/


Lessons learned?
----------------

We released v0.14.0 without breaking changes notice and migration docs which hurt our users
from upgrading. From now on, we will avoid introducing breaking changes but should add deprecated
warnings before breaking things for the next version releases.

v0.14.1 is on its way to fix this problem by updating the changelog and docs.

So rest assured and enjoy the release :-).


What's next?
------------

We created a roadmap release for v0.15.0 and we're waiting for the community feedbacks and ideas for
it.

We will add more sample projects, some projects with integration with other
popular libraries to create top-notch REST APIs. If you have such projects to be promoted,
please let us know then.


Enjoy and happy hacking!
