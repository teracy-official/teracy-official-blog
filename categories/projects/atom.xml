    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been more than two months since we introduced the inception of the <code>kubernetes-stack</code> cookbook
from the blog post <a href="/2017/06/15/how-to-extend-teracy-dev-to-work-with-kubernetes/">How to extend teracy-dev to work with Kubernetes</a> and today we&rsquo;re
very happy to announce its very first milestone release.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>What&rsquo;s new?</h2>

<p>This milestone release helps us to manage the installation of these packages: <code>kubectl</code>, <code>helm</code>,
and <code>gcloud</code> automatically.</p>

<p>These are the client packages which are used to communicate and to work with the Google Cloud Platform,
Google Container Engine or any other Kubenertes servers.</p>

<p>You can install, remove any valid versions of those packages onto Ubuntu or CentOS platforms and more
supported platforms will come.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s next?</h2>

<p>This cookbook is designed to provide utilities for us to work with <code>Kubernetes</code> stack, so the next
milestone will introduce <code>kubernetes</code> resource to set up and install <code>Kubernetes</code> server which
should work the same as <code>Minukube</code> with better developer productivity enhancement. This
will allow our developers to have a quick local deployment test with k8s on their workstations.</p>

<p>By using this, we can save a lot of server cost, reduce testing time and speed up delivery time of
application deployment.</p>

<p>Developers will understand <code>Kubernetes</code> more deeply when they can do whatever they want with it.
It&rsquo;s very safe! They can destroy and set up a new deployment anytime they want without causing any
harm to their co-workers.</p>

<p>You should check out how it should be used with <code>teracy-dev</code> at <a href="https://github.com/acme101/dev-setup/blob/develop/chef/main-cookbooks/acme/recipes/k8s.rb">https://github.com/acme101/dev-setup/blob/develop/chef/main-cookbooks/acme/recipes/k8s.rb</a></p>

<p>I hope that this free cookbook could make your lives easier when working with <code>Kubernetes</code>:

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We&rsquo;re very happy to announce our so long awaiting major release of teracy-dev, the v0.5.0-b1 release
that introduces lots of features and changes, high performance with Docker workflow as the default.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>v0.5.0-b1</h2>

<p>This is the beta 1 release of v0.5.0, what does it mean? By following the
<a href="http://dev.teracy.org/docs/semantic_versioning.html">semantic versioning guide</a>, it means:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>features completed, only minor bugs are expected. Avoid refactoring here, just fix bugs</p></blockquote></p>

<p>This v0.5.0-b1 release is tested with all our projects and our clients' projects, so we can guarantee
that the release has a very high quality and stability that you can use it for everyday projects.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re still lacking lots of documentation guides for users to explore and leverage all the supported
features more easily.</p>

<h2>Changes</h2>

<p>This major release includes lots of features and improvements:</p>

<ul>
<li>high performance on Windows, especially file syncing</li>
<li>Docker workflow out of the box, can use any versions of docker, docker-compose</li>
<li>support all type of provisioners configurations</li>
<li>use public_network by default</li>
<li>config override the object within array</li>
<li>Vagrantfile-ext support</li>
<li>use rsync as the default sync mechanism (with the support from vagrant-gatling-rsync and
vagrant-rsync-back plugins)</li>
<li>reverse proxy support with /etc/hosts update for auto domain management</li>
<li>auto vagrant plugins installation support</li>
</ul>


<p>There are more that you should explore yourselves when using <code>teracy-dev</code> for a while.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s next?</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;re working hard to add more documentations and guides. We&rsquo;ll fix bugs if any.</p>

<p>After v0.5.0 final is release, we&rsquo;ll take on the next major release v0.6.0 that follow our
<a href="/2016/08/19/teracy-dev-vision/">teracy-dev&rsquo;s vision</a>:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>teracy-dev is the best universal development tool for everyone.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll take all the feedback from v0.5.0 usage to continue making <code>teracy-dev</code> better and greater.</p>

    <id>http://blog.teracy.com/2016/12/20/teracy-dev-the-only-truly-universal-productive-development-platform-with-docker-on-macos-linux-and-windows</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Docker is great to work with, it solves a lot of problems on development, distribution, and production
deployment.</p>

<p>Why Docker?  You can find the answer here:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://thenewstack.io/why-did-docker-catch-on-quickly-and-why-is-it-so-interesting/">http://thenewstack.io/why-did-docker-catch-on-quickly-and-why-is-it-so-interesting/</a></li>

<li><a href="https://blog.codeship.com/why-docker/">https://blog.codeship.com/why-docker/</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Docker works great on Linux, however, it&rsquo;s very challenging to make it work universal and consistent on
Mac and Windows. There are lots of efforts to solve this problem, from Docker themselves and from
Docker community, too. However, we haven&rsquo;t achieved that stage yet (until <code>teracy-dev</code>).</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>These are some of the problems that Docker community has to deal with on Mac and Windows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>No consistent universal development environment and workflow on Linux, Windows, Mac. This is a very
important factor for team collaboration so that anyone from any OS platforms could collaborate and help
each other with no differences in the development environment.</p></li>
<li><p>Mounted volumes on VirtualBox use vboxsf, which is extremely slow. This is true for Boot2Docker and
Vagrant default file sync mechanism on Virtualbox.</p></li>
<li><p>Native Docker applications offered by Docker:</p>

<ul>
<li>Slow on Mac: <a href="https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/77">https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/77</a></li>
<li>Only recent latest versions of Window 10 (&ldquo;Build 10586 or later&rdquo;) are supported</li>
<li>Slow on Windows: <a href="https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/188">https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/188</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>File watching is broken on VirtualBox since vboxsf does not trigger the inotify file watching
mechanism. <code>nodemon</code>, hello?</p></li>
</ul>


<p>There are a lot of Docker community projects trying to solve those problems:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/brikis98/docker-osx-dev">https://github.com/brikis98/docker-osx-dev</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/blinkreaction/boot2docker-vagrant">https://github.com/blinkreaction/boot2docker-vagrant</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/codekitchen/dinghy">https://github.com/codekitchen/dinghy</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/leighmcculloch/docker-unison">https://github.com/leighmcculloch/docker-unison</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/gansbrest/hodor">https://github.com/gansbrest/hodor</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/adlogix/docker-machine-nfs">https://github.com/adlogix/docker-machine-nfs</a></li>
<li>others&hellip;</li>
</ul>


<p>However, those existing projects do not really resolve all the problems or do not reflect
our vision for a productive development platform.</p>

<p>You can check out our <a href="/2016/08/19/teracy-dev-vision/">vision for teracy-dev</a> for such the
productive development platform.</p>

<p>That is the reason why we created <code>teracy-dev</code>. We&rsquo;ve been using and loving it for more than 3 years
and counting.</p>

<p><code>teracy-dev</code> reflects our vision for a truly universal productive development platform that anyone can
use to develop software easily. It&rsquo;s very easy to customize any OS that you can use
for your VM. It brings development and production environment closer and closer.</p>

<p>It is very important for a distributed team like us to work with everyone from different teams all
over the world on different projects with different stacks and <code>teracy-dev</code> helps us a lot.</p>

<p>Moreover, <code>teracy-dev</code> is not tightly coupled with anything, you&rsquo;re free to choose anything to build
up your development VM machine. You can choose different OS platforms, choose different software packages to
be automatically installed with the help of different configuration management tools. It&rsquo;s up
to you to choose anything other than default settings.</p>

<p>With default settings, <code>teracy-dev</code> chooses Ubuntu as the base OS with <code>docker</code> and <code>docker-compose</code>
installed to start developing software with Docker right away after <code>$ vagrant up</code>.</p>

<p>teracy-dev v0.5.0 is leveraging Docker for development as we believe in the future of containers
and Docker.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s have some comparisons between <code>teracy-dev</code> and other solutions:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>   Criteria                         </th>
<th> teracy-dev </th>
<th> docker-osx-dev </th>
<th> Docker Toolbox </th>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>✅: fully support</p>

<p>❌: no or partial support</p>

<p>🚫: can be achieved but not encouraged</p>

<p>Let me explain the criteria:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>&ldquo;same workflow on Linux, Mac, Windows&rdquo;: the usage should be the same on Mac, Linux, Windows.
Docker native app only supports >= Windows 10, that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s marked as ❌.</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;native speed on mounted volumes&rdquo;: the speed should be as fast and native as on Linux</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;2-way file sync&rdquo;: for syncing back and forth on mounted volumes, this is mandatory for development</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;file watching (inotify)&rdquo;: for auto reload when files change</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;customization&rdquo;: you have full control and are encouraged to change anything that you want to
suit your need, no hidden stuff, no lock-in and can still upgrade seamlessly.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Let&rsquo;s see what the same workflow means when developing a simple hello world <code>nodejs</code> application
from scratch with teracy-dev by watching the following videos:</p>

<p>On Linux (Ubuntu):</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ze8p9imprgk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>On Windows:</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2200zvxIdAs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>On macOS:</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XF-FQQKG8PA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>They all contain the same steps, that&rsquo;s the meaning of the &ldquo;same workflow&rdquo;.</p>

<p><code>teracy-dev</code> is not perfect, though. There are some improvements that we&rsquo;d like to address.</p>

<p>The first thing we&rsquo;d like to improve is to reduce the setup time. It takes time (around 20-30 mins)
to download the vagrant box (Ubuntu 16.04) for the first time. This is for the first time only, however.
After the first time, you can destroy and provision the same VM within some minutes. We could use
some other smaller boxes (for example, boot2docker base box) but we&rsquo;d like to stick to the most popular
Linux OS that is widely used in production. We try to make development and production environment as
close as possible. This is by default, you can choose different base boxes as you wish.</p>

<p><code>teracy-dev</code> v0.5.0 is under preview stage, we need to add more documentation and get more community
feedback.</p>

<p><code>teracy-dev</code> is created to give back to open source community as we learn and get a lot from our amazing
open source community.</p>

<p>And we need you, please try and let us know your feedback and we&rsquo;ll together fix any problems.</p>

<p>You should get started with <code>teracy-dev</code> here: <a href="http://dev.teracy.org/docs/develop/getting_started.html">http://dev.teracy.org/docs/develop/getting_started.html</a></p>

<p>In summary, <code>teracy-dev</code> brings <code>Docker</code> closer to <code>Vagrant</code> = love.</p>

<p>Thank you and happy hacking with <a href="https://github.com/teracyhq/dev">teracy-dev</a>!</p>
